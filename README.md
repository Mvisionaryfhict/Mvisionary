# Mvisionary Readme

Hey there, I'm Mitchel!

### About Me
Since I was young, I've been fascinated by people's thoughts and stories. Whether it's individuals navigating life's complexities, those in the realm of technology, or the arts, each person holds a unique tale. A past event might influence your future, but it doesn't define it. You, yourself, carve your path from the past to now and beyond.

### What's My Story?
Like everyone else, I have a story to share. I strive to depict my narrative through code and digital arts. Since 2014, I've been immersed in the gaming industry, leading Mvisionary Studios. We aim to visualize stories that reside solely in our thoughts.

### Passion for IT and Education
Fueled by a passion for all things tech, I aim to empower future generations with knowledge. By actively shaping the future, I immortalize the past in my code, art, and digital archives.

### Sharing Stories, Creating Safe Tech Spaces
Through tech articles, code creations, and visuals, I aim to offer a window into global events. Assisting companies in crafting and maintaining secure tech environments allows for the safe dissemination and eternal preservation of stories, mine and others'.

### Vision for the Tech Future
My diverse interests, showcased on my website, lead me to engage in various tech endeavors. However, I aim to specialize in the coming years. Currently involved in coding games, mastering languages, pursuing IT degrees, and writing tech articles, I also manage websites, design logos, and more. My ultimate goal is to contribute to making the online world a safer space, ensuring security for future tech users. Together, we mold the future, and its direction lies in our hands.
